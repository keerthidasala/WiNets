This course has a semester long project. The goal of the course project is to enable students to
experience various aspects of software security research. The result of the project will be a 
conference-style presentation. This is a semester-long project and is recommended to be done in
groups of up to three students. Each project group is expected to decide milestones and will
receive grades based on the satisfactory completion of these milestones and the presentation.
Potential project ideas are [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tmm2GvXN-9Uo8grPoXuJoPQM2JYPeSCf8a16RkJmFkA/).
Although, students can pick a project of their choice after discussing it with the professor.

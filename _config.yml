course_name: Holistic Software Security
course_description: "The goal of the course is to bootstrap you into software security research. The
course provides a complete overview of different aspects of software security and
standard techniques used to solve various software security problems. We discuss
generic techniques such as Data flow analysis/ type inference/ dynamic analysis
that are also needed to perform research in other areas such as Software engineering
and program analysis.
The course is composed of four components: (i) Vulnerability Finding, (ii) Automated Patching, (iii) Patch Propagation, and (iv) Vulnerability Prevention.
<ul>
<li>Vulnerability Finding: We understand the basics of vulnerability finding techniques: Static analysis
(Pattern-based/ Dataflow based/ Type-based/DSL based), Dynamic Analysis (Different Flavors of Fuzzing
and dynamic symbolic execution), Machine Learning, and a combination of all the above.</li>

<li>Automated Patching: Automated Program repair techniques: Pattern-based/ Dynamic analysis based/ Machine learning etc.</li>

<li>Patch Propagation: Understanding the problem of propagating patches caused by software diversity
and potential solutions.</li>

<li>Vulnerability Prevention: Type-safe languages (Rust, Go, etc.), Retrofitting techniques (Sanitizers: ASAN, etc.),
Type-safe dialects (Checked C/Cyclone/etc.).</li>
</ul>

For every component, we will start with basics and cover the state-of-the-art techniques.
We will also be reading research papers and try to analyze the pros and cons critically."
